1 Make list C of possible combinations 	(colors^spots)
2 Play 1122 P
3 Read user input I						(black = correct color & place, white = correct color & wrong place)
4 If won, stop game
5 Remove invalid combinations from list	(if the solution would be C what pegs would 1122 get? If those pegs != I, remove C from list)
6 Play next possible move from list
7 Repeat 3

Main class:
	Listens to user input and loops 3 to 7 until won
	
CombinationList:
	Generates list of combinations based on colors and spots
	Updates list to remove invalid combinations
	
Comparer:
	Takes two color sets and provides pegs
